You are in the middle of Bree. All around you are shops, houses, and other types of dwellings. From the north you hear music, and its lively sound beckons you. The Old East Road comes from the west and continues through the village. After leaving Bree to the south, it stretches to the Hithaeglir Mountains. To the north you see the Prancing Pony Inn, and the stables east.
