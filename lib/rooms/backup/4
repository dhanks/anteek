You have entered a medium-sized room with solid wooden floors. You see a
large cheerful fireplace on your right, and a large desk at the far end of
the room. Behind the desk stands a man who cautiously acknowledges you.
Behind him lies a corridor of rooms for people who can afford them, and
whom the Innkeeper should trust.
