A high wooden ceiling looks down upon the busy stables of the Prancing Pony
Inn. At the front of each sizeable stable stands a trough full of clean
refreshing water. The stables were made for the many mounted travellers
that stop off at Bree for a rest. A note is pinned to the wall near the
front of the stables.
