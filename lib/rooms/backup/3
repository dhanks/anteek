You stand in the main room of the Prancing Pony Inn. A big table is in the
middle of the room and some smaller ones are around in dimly lit corners.
Here hobbits and foreigners talk loudly of the events happening in the
farthest regions of Middle Earth. You can catch snatches of conversations about
Fornost, Rivendell, Tharbad, The Grey Havens, ... and the unnamed Shadow that
grows in the East.
