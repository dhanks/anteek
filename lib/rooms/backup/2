You are in the big common-room of this inn. The gathering is large and
mixed, as you discover when your eyes get used to the light. This comes
chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for the three lamps hanging from the beams
are dim, and half-veiled in smoke. You notice a bar just to your right and a
man behind waiting for customers. A door leads to the south and a wooden
sign hangs next to the bar.
