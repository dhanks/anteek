 Prancing Pony Inn is a fun chat environment, open to anyone, 24/7.
                      Come relax, chat and enjoy!

* If you wish to come back, we suggest you gain residency. That allows
  you to use more advanced features, and establish a password. (Ask
  a SuperUser (SU) by typing: lsu  then: tell <name> <msg>.)

* Everything that happens in private, remains private. Anything you do
  in a private room or in a private tell cannot be snooped or inter-
  cepted by anybody but the people you intended to talk to.

* The administration is not liable for any thing you or anyone else does
  while connected to this program. Period. Use at your own risk.

* The rules are as follows:
   - Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
   - Don't be abusive, offensive or annoying to other characters.
   - Don't use someone else's stupidity to be an excuse for your own.
   - Administrators' actions are beyond argument.
