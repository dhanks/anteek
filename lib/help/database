^HHelp System^N

Welcome to Prancing Pony Inn.  This help engine is driven by keywords and
topics.  To use help, just give the engine a topic to search

help communication

If the engine returns with multiple results, you can pick which section
you would like to read, by re-entering the command, prefixed with the
section number and a period

help 1.communication

It's strongly recommended you read 2.intro, 3.intro, and 4.intro for
command usage, general information, and references.
